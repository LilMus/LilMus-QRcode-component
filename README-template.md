## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I basically learned that eventhough I used <body> as a container for flexbox I need to enter dimensions for it. As putting a background color covered all my browser I thought the dimension would naturally be 100% in both axis but it was not. I also learned about vw and vh units.

### Continued development

I understood that flexbox is a powerful tool to place objects on a page so I want to keep practicing it alongside with grids.
